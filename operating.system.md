## OS Visualiser

try building this https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-1069343866-vertical-format--futuristic-digitally-generated-motion, and call it kernel vision. I wish someone built a vision program that can question and enquire what it sees.

### Instructions to build it

1. clone a linux os
2. Modify the os so that it emits all the arguments and functions
3. Create a 3d visualiser that runs with time in one axis and accumulate the logs
4. Create tooling in 3d visualiser that can decorate the data :D
