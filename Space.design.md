# Space design

## Magic item
The magic item is part of space. It senses the space vibration around it.

## Source
The source is an item that can cause space vibration like music, sound etc.


## Design

1. The magic item is designed and put in space
2. The magic item receives the sound vibrations
3. The magic item senses and tries to predict the position of source of the sound in space, kind of source space density that is capable to make such vibration, and kind of movement of that particular space density item.


For example, the magic item will sense the distance of the source space (music instrument)
the music instrument makes vibration in space, so the magic item will try to predict what external force will make the music item to make the vibration.
In our case it is a wind, so it will create a wind source.
and it will try to find the wind source, and on and on.


this design will help to build a system that can sense the space vibration and use the signal to build a predictive design. A world within a world. 

Everyone goes with a finding that we are inside a simulator, so what? what will you do next ? keep talking to others about the same thing and repeat over and over again?

I wanted to put an effort to figure out how to build one based on the world we live in.

## motivation
If you learn CSS, you can understand everything in css and build with CSS
If you learn math, you can understand everything else in math
.
.
.
If you learn (magic), you can understand everything in magic and build it back.
.
.
.
.
So take a learning medium and teach it something, next time it sees something, it will try to recreate it.

so if you teach an AI to see colors, it can only create the world back in colors :D.


## References

Bible - In the beginning there was words and word created light. Indian culture - In the beginning there was om sound. 

What's common is, in the beginning there was sound, the sound created everything else. Sound is the source so taking that as inspiration I started studying more about sound.

Properties of magic item

Senses vibration around it,
Guesses and builds source of it,

this is a blind man's world. How to make the blind man see? Truth - if you keep training the magic ball with all our world's space disturbance, it will eventually be able to predict the source of light, and it starts the blast - bing bang :D ðŸ¥‡
the magic ball is a blind man's in a computer. Along with sense of space, it can question munam, our answers will help it better train.
