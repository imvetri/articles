## writing my mind out

Interesting post in hackernews today - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27223520 	Physicists identify the engine powering black hole energy beams 

Its fun and irresponsible to talk about space. Everyone knows it is endless and even then choose to waste time in it. Why? Lost minds always find a place in the universe hahaha.

Okay. The article is about blackhole jets. An year back, when I tried cutting myself from internet I started finding my original ideas. I broke my gap from internet and got back.

I read news that blackholes merger generated spark, and some blackholes merger was with no spark. Here is the fact that I had. Blackholes can be solid or fluid. During blackhole merger, if one of them is fluid, no light sparks out of it, if both of them are solid, light will spark.

I opened r/space and made a new post - Black holes are solids or fluids. I got kicked out. which was good :D.

Another interesting theory I had is, a dellusional mind's theory, universe is a simulation/hallucination/imagination etc.. so what we see isn't what we see. hahaha. 

Most of the time, I rely my theories based on a fact that everything in universe is made of samething, what is the samething ? leave it. just assume that everything share something in common. Stars / planets / sun are the same thing just like atoms, molecules etc...


you know why? We are the center piece in the universe. we can see things that are bigger than us, and we can see things that are smaller than us. If we see microscopic and macroscopic objects resized to similar size and filter out similar visual behaviour I found that planetary spinning objects like stars and sun and planets around sun is same as an atomic structure of electrons around it.

now question is how does an atom generate electric field? when a current is passed to it, how a current is created ? based on the left hand / right hand rule of maxmillan when a mag (hahaha found the answer for blackhole jet, update the thread later) alright stick to the point. an electric pulse gets created from a spinning atom / or is it electron moving from one atom to another ? dammit. lets idiotically connect both the facts and stick to the point that
electric current / pulse is created when a magnetic atom spins, spinning magnetic blackhole also jets pulse hahaha. science fiction ends now.

when a blackhole jets energy, there will be another parallel.


## Comment I made

My theories, and its all based on the fact that universe is simulation/ we are the creators/ everything is illusion/ hallucination and underlying fact is nothing can be correct. based on that, some cooked up theories.
Light travels in a straight line towards gravity.

- This is not cooked up and It can't be proven wrong as well, i guess.

Light and space expands when mass emits energy. - Sun Light and space collapse when mass absorbs energy - Gravity hole / blackhole These two complement each other.

- This is not cooked up, its based on EMC2

Black hole has intense mass density, An atom also has intense mass density. when atom spins, electric pulse gets created, why? when blackhole spins, black hole jets energy beams.

- This is cooked up. but looking at the visualisation it kind of makes sense.

### Lesson
Stop wasting time in reading internet, build something. 
Stop wasting time building something, run away from computer.
